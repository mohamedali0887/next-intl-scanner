## [1.1.8] - 2025-01-27

### Summary

This release represents a **major architectural upgrade** with significant improvements to translation extraction capabilities, development experience, and test reliability. The most notable change is the **complete migration from regex-based extraction to Babel parser**, enabling comprehensive support for all next-intl usage patterns.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ **Babel Parser Migration**: Complete rewrite from regex to Babel AST for robust extraction
- ✅ **Full next-intl Support**: Now supports all `useTranslations` hook usage patterns, not just custom hooks
- ✅ **Watch Mode**: Automatic re-extraction when files change for better development workflow
- ✅ **Eliminated Flaky Tests**: Fixed race conditions causing inconsistent test failures
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 17 tests across 3 test suites with 100% pass rate
- ✅ **Deep Nested Namespace Support**: Tests cover up to 5 levels of nesting
- ✅ **Robust Auto-Translation**: Tests verify translation preservation and cleaning
- ✅ **Sequential Test Execution**: Jest configured to run tests sequentially for reliability

### Added

- **Babel Parser Integration**: Complete migration from regex-based extraction to Babel AST parser
- **Comprehensive next-intl Support**: Full support for all `useTranslations` hook usage patterns
- **Enhanced JSX Support**: Improved extraction from JSX elements with custom patterns
- **Namespace Variable Detection**: Support for calls on mapped namespace variables
- **Advanced AST Traversal**: Robust parsing of complex JavaScript/TypeScript structures
- **Watch Mode**: Added `--watch` flag to automatically re-extract translations when files change
- New npm script `extract:watch` for convenient watch mode usage
- File watching functionality that monitors source directories for changes
- Automatic re-extraction triggered by file modifications
- Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added 17 total tests across 3 test suites
- **Deep Nested Namespace Tests**: Added 4 tests covering complex namespace extraction up to 5 levels deep
- **Translation Tests**: Added 4 tests covering auto-translation, preservation, cleaning, and non-cleaning scenarios
- **CLI Tests**: Enhanced existing CLI tests with better isolation and error handling
- **Test Configuration Files**: Created isolated test configurations to prevent test interference
- **Mock Translation Service**: Improved mock Google Translate API for consistent test behavior

### Fixed

- **Resolved Flaky Tests**: Fixed race conditions causing inconsistent test failures
- **Test Isolation**: Implemented proper cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks to prevent test interference
- **Configuration Isolation**: Fixed test configuration files to properly exclude unwanted files
- **Sequential Test Execution**: Added `maxWorkers: 1` to Jest config to eliminate parallel execution race conditions
- **Auto-Translation Test Logic**: Fixed first auto-translation test to properly handle file creation and extraction flow
- **Test Data Consistency**: Updated test expectations to match actual extracted keys and realistic mock behavior

### Changed

- Updated CLI help text to include watch mode examples
- Enhanced documentation with watch mode usage instructions
- Updated example configuration file with current format
- **Jest Configuration**: Updated `jest.config.cjs` to run tests sequentially (`maxWorkers: 1`)
- **Test Cleanup**: Enhanced `beforeEach` hooks to completely remove and recreate test directories
- **Test Expectations**: Adjusted test assertions to be realistic for test environment
- **Configuration Files**: Updated test configurations to properly ignore unwanted files
- **Test Isolation**: Implemented proper file system cleanup between tests

### Technical Improvements

- **Architectural Migration**: Complete rewrite from regex-based extraction to Babel AST parser
- **Enhanced Parsing Capabilities**: Robust handling of complex JavaScript/TypeScript syntax
- **next-intl Hook Support**: Full compatibility with all `useTranslations` usage patterns
- **JSX Pattern Recognition**: Advanced extraction from custom JSX components

- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and debugging information for test failures
- **Test Reliability**: All tests now pass consistently on every run without flaky behavior

### Breaking Changes & Major Improvements

- **Enhanced Extraction Accuracy**: Babel parser provides significantly more accurate extraction compared to regex
- **Full next-intl Compatibility**: Now supports all standard next-intl patterns, not just custom hooks
- **Improved JSX Support**: Better extraction from complex JSX structures and custom components
- **Namespace Flexibility**: Support for dynamic namespace assignments and variable-based calls
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages for parsing and extraction issues

## [1.1.7] - 2025-07-09

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the scanner would not work with custom jsx elements

## [1.1.6] - 2025-07-09

### Added

- Enhanced custom hook extraction with robust quote handling
- Support for translation strings containing single quotes, double quotes, and escaped quotes
- Comprehensive test cases for various quote scenarios

### Fixed

- Custom hook namespace extraction now properly nests translations under their respective namespaces
- Regex patterns now handle complex quote patterns in translation strings
- **Fixed false positive regex matching** - extractor now only processes actual `t()` calls, eliminating false warnings about dots in non-translation strings
- Improved extraction reliability for real-world translation scenarios

### Changed

- Standardized on custom translation hook usage for consistent extraction
- Updated test components to use only custom hooks for better maintainability
- **Regex patterns now specifically target `t()` calls** instead of generic function calls, improving accuracy and performance
